Wind Transposition Model (WTM) is an application dedicated to correct wind data for building energy performance applications. 

It modifies data collected in remote areas in weather stations to account for the topography and roughness of the project site.

WTM uses CFD data pre-calculated using the software [WindStation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WindStation) and applies machine learning techniques to modify weather data entries in climate files.
